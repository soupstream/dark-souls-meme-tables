### Dark Souls Meme Tables

Some Cheat Engine tables I've made for Dark Souls. What I have so far:

* Always whiff (DS1/DS1R)
  * Weapons with a whiff animation will always whiff, even if you hit an enemy. Use the four-pronged plow for best results.
* Disable wall clinking (DS1/DS1R)
  * This is actually kind of useful but most importantly it prevents walls from cancelling your whiff animation
